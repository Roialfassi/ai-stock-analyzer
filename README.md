  - OR run locally with LM Studio (no API key needed)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roialfassi/ai-stock-analyzer.git
cd ai-stock-analyzer
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

### Command Line Usage

The application includes a CLI for automation and quick startup:

```bash
# List all saved presets
python cli.py --list

# Run with a specific preset
python cli.py --preset "My GPT-4 Config"

# Skip market data download for faster startup
python cli.py --preset "Quick Start" --skip-market-data

# Run in demo mode with mock data
python cli.py --preset "Local LLM" --demo

# Create a new preset from command line
python cli.py --create "Production" --provider openai --api-key "sk-..." --model gpt-4
```
